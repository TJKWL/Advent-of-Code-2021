# Advent-of-Code-2021
The python code I wrote for the Advent of Code event in 2021, https://adventofcode.com/2021.

"
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
"

Each Advent of Code question is comprised of 2 parts, the first part is usually easier and is used to help lead up to the second part, which is more challenging and requires more time and problem solving. A lot of the code in this repository may be geared towards solving just the second part of the question, since elements required to solve the first part of the problem may have been deleted.
